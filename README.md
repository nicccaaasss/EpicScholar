## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **ESP32** connects to your laptop (or phone) via **Bluetooth**.
2. When the **EpicScholar Self Study** mode is opened, it detects the connected AR Glass.
3. The website sends updates such as:

   * Current topic
   * Time remaining
   * AI tips
   * Notes or quiz questions
4. These updates are displayed on the **OLED screen** inside the AR glass.
5. When the **button** is pressed, the **mic** activates. The student can ask questions like:

   > “What is Newton’s second law?”
6. The laptop receives the voice input, the **EpicScholar AI** processes it, and sends back a short text answer to the AR display.
7. The student sees the answer instantly on the lens — without breaking focus from studying.

## 🔁 Example Usage

A student wears the AR Glass and opens **Self Study** on EpicScholar.
The glass shows:

```
📘 Physics: Gravitation  
⏱️ 44:59 Remaining  
AI Tip: Focus on Universal Law
```

The student presses the mic button and asks:

> “What’s the formula for gravitational force?”

The AI responds on the glass:

```
F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²
```

This makes studying hands-free, interactive, and futuristic.
